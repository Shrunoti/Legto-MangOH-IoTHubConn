These A\+P\+Is are on the top of the platform-\/dependent adapter layer. They are independent of the implementation. They guarantee the portability on different kind of platform without any changes for the components developped upon these A\+P\+Is.\hypertarget{c_pa_sms_pa_sms_rational}{}\section{Rational}\label{c_pa_sms_pa_sms_rational}
These functions are all blocking functions, so that they return when the modem has answered or when a timeout has occured due to an interrupted communication with the modem.

They all verify the validity and the range of the input parameters before performing the modem operation.

Some functions are used to get some information with a fixed pattern string (i.\+e. pa\+\_\+sms\+\_\+\+Rd\+Msg\+From\+Mem), in this case no buffer overflow will occur has they always get a fixed string length.
