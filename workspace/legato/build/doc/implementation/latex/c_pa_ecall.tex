These A\+P\+Is are on the top of the platform-\/dependent adapter layer. They are independent of the implementation. They guarantee the portability on different kind of platform without any changes for the components developped upon these A\+P\+Is.\hypertarget{c_pa_ecall_pa_ecall_rational}{}\section{Rational}\label{c_pa_ecall_pa_ecall_rational}
These functions are all blocking functions, so that they return when the modem has answered or when a timeout has occured due to an interrupted communication with the modem.

They all verify the validity and the range of the input parameters before performing the modem operation.
