The mk\+Tools parsers are composed of a Lexer and multiple parsing functions.

There\textquotesingle{}s a set of parsing functions for each type of definition file (.cdef, .adef, .mdef and .sdef), and there\textquotesingle{}s one function in each set for each definition file format version supported. There is also a very limited functionality parser for extracting dependencies from .api files.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{lexer_8h}{lexer.\+h}
\item \hyperlink{cdef_parser_8h}{cdef\+Parser.\+h}
\item \hyperlink{adef_parser_8h}{adef\+Parser.\+h}
\item \hyperlink{mdef_parser_8h}{mdef\+Parser.\+h}
\item \hyperlink{sdef_parser_8h}{sdef\+Parser.\+h}
\item \hyperlink{api_parser_8h}{api\+Parser.\+h}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Also, there\textquotesingle{}s a set of parsing functions declared in \hyperlink{parser_8h}{parser.\+h} that are shared by multiple parsers.

The Lexer analyzes the input stream and generates lexical tokens from it. All parsing functions use the same Lexer class to do the lexical analysis. The Lexer provides a Throw\+Exception() function, which is used internally and by the parsing functions to throw exceptions containing error reports with the current file path, line number and column number in them.
