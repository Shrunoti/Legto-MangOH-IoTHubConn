Welcome mang\+OH board developers. If you\textquotesingle{}ve successfully setup your mang\+OH board, congrats you\textquotesingle{}ve already run your first Legato app!

If you\textquotesingle{}ve landed here and haven\textquotesingle{}t setup your mang\+OH board, go to \href{http://mangoh.io/mangoh-red-resources-getting-started}{\tt mang\+O\+H.\+io} to get started.\hypertarget{mangohDevelopers_mangohDevelopers_installed}{}\section{What was installed}\label{mangohDevelopers_mangohDevelopers_installed}
While you were setting up your mang\+OH board, all the prerequisites, toolchain, and source code files were loaded onto your computer. When you ran {\ttfamily hello\+World}, you used the \href{https://github.com/legatoproject/legato-af/tree/master/apps/sample/helloWorld}{\tt hello\+World sample app}.\hypertarget{mangohDevelopers_mangohDevelopers_helloWorld}{}\section{What hello\+World used}\label{mangohDevelopers_mangohDevelopers_helloWorld}
By making and then running the hello\+World sample app, you\textquotesingle{}ve already used all the \hyperlink{getStartedApps}{basic pieces} required by a Legato app\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item one component containing its \hyperlink{defFilesCdef}{.cdef} file
\item one app source file
\item \hyperlink{defFilesAdef}{.adef} file of the app
\end{DoxyItemize}

When you built hello\+World (by running {\ttfamily \$ mkapp -\/t wp85 hello\+World.\+adef}), the necessary files and libs were created for your target\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Legato application bundle \+: hello\+App/hello\+App.\+wp85
\item build folder \+: hello\+App/\+\_\+build\+\_\+hello\+App/wp85/ with the executables in hello\+App/\+\_\+build\+\_\+test\+App/wp85/staging/bin/ and with the libraries in hello\+App/\+\_\+build\+\_\+test\+App/wp85/staging/lib/.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{mangohDevelopers_mangohDevelopers_nextSteps}{}\section{Next Steps}\label{mangohDevelopers_mangohDevelopers_nextSteps}
\hyperlink{buildAppsMain}{Build Apps} is super easy. All you do is\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item create a component
\item create an app definition file
\item build your app
\item install app on target.
\end{DoxyItemize}

That\textquotesingle{}s it! You\textquotesingle{}re ready to use Legato apps.

You can develop starting with pre-\/built sample apps\+: ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{sampleApps}{Sample Apps} available in the app/sample/ directories.
\item \href{https://github.com/legatoproject/legato-af/tree/master/apps/sample}{\tt legato.\+io} to clone the sample apps from Git\+Hub.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Or you can develop apps from scratch\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{getStartedApps}{Tutorials}
\item \hyperlink{howToMain}{How To}
\end{DoxyItemize}
