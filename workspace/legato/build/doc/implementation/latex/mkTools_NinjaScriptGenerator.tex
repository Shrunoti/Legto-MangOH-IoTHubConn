There are various ninja build scripts that get generated by this module.

There\textquotesingle{}s a function to generate each type of .ninja\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ninja\+::\+Generate(\+Component\+\_\+t$\ast$) -\/ Stand-\/alone component library.
\item ninja\+::\+Generate(\+Exe\+\_\+t$\ast$) -\/ Executable and associated component libraries.
\item ninja\+::\+Generate(\+App\+\_\+t$\ast$) -\/ Application bundle, including executables, component libraries, bundled files, a configuration data file, and an info.\+properties file.
\item ninja\+::\+Generate(\+System\+\_\+t$\ast$) -\/ System bundle, including all app bundles and user binding configuration.
\end{DoxyItemize}

None of the scripts do configuration generation or exe main code generation. The scripts expect those things to be done before the scripts are run. The ninja scripts will run ifgen to generate interface code, though.

Each script includes a rule to check that none of the definition files that it is generated from have been changed. If they have, the script will delete itself and run the appropriate mktool to regenerate itself.
