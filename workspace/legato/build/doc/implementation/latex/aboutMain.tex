Legato AF releases are not tied to any specific processor product release. Once we have released Legato AF, processor vendors (like Sierra Wireless) will take the Legato AF and integrate it into their own product release.

{\bfseries  Legato AF Release Schedule VS Processor Vendor Release Schedule }



Example\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Legato AF Team posts release 17.\+07
\item Processor Vendor takes release 17.\+07 and builds an associated Linux Distro to create a \char`\"{}\+Legato
   Platform\char`\"{}
\item Processor Vendor tests and releases a \char`\"{}\+Legato Platform\char`\"{} with their Modem Firmware as \char`\"{}\+Product
   Release Y\char`\"{}
\item Legato AF Team posts release 17.\+08, 17.\+09 and 17.\+10 without the Processor Vendor packaging it into a Product Release. Releases are able to installed with the vendor\textquotesingle{}s Product Release Y, but {\bfseries  may not be officially supported by the Processor Vendor. }
\item Processor Vendor takes release 17.\+11 and creates a \char`\"{}\+Legato Platform\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+Product Release Z\char`\"{}, and so on..
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries For any questions about the Product Releases please contact your Processor Vendor directly.}

Legato AF releases are not tied to any specific module product release. Once we have released Legato AF, module vendors (like Sierra Wireless) will take the release and integrate it into their own {\bfseries  product release. }

{\bfseries  Legato AF Release Schedule VS Module Vendor Release Schedule }



Example\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Legato AF Team posts release 17.\+07
\item Module Vendor takes release 17.\+07 and builds an associated Linux Distro to create a \char`\"{}\+Legato
   Platform\char`\"{}
\item Module Vendor tests and releases a \char`\"{}\+Legato Platform\char`\"{} with their Modem Firmware as \char`\"{}\+Product
   Release Y\char`\"{}
\item Legato AF Team posts release 17.\+08, 17.\+09 and 17.\+010 without the Module Vendor packaging it into a Product Release. Releases are able to installed with the vendor\textquotesingle{}s Product Release Y, but {\bfseries  may not be officially supported by the Module Vendor. }
\item Module Vendor takes release 17.\+11 and creates a \char`\"{}\+Legato Platform\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+Product Release Z\char`\"{}, and so on..

The following provides a summary of changes that have been made in the 17.\+05 Legato AF Release.

{\bfseries  Download the \hyperlink{aboutReleaseInfo}{source code} and get started with \hyperlink{basicBuild}{building Legato AF}. }\hypertarget{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_Features}{}\subsubsection{New Features}\label{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_Features}
\hypertarget{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesFwupdate}{}\paragraph{fwupdate Service}\label{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesFwupdate}
fwupdate now includes the following features\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Suspend/\+Resume feature added -\/ the fwupdate service now supports suspending and resuming updates in the case of a loss of connection or power.
\item fwupdate is split into two functions \hyperlink{le__fwupdate__interface_8h_ab68f3a7c5d4284306468e888bf6a8796}{le\+\_\+fwupdate\+\_\+\+Download()} to download updates, and \hyperlink{le__fwupdate__interface_8h_a534e72fc1a6c20a36a9bdf4a58074159}{le\+\_\+fwupdate\+\_\+\+Install()} to install the update.
\end{DoxyItemize}

See \hyperlink{c_fwupdate}{fwupdate} for further information the new features for updating firmware\hypertarget{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesIncDefFiles}{}\paragraph{Def Files Inclusion in other Def Files}\label{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesIncDefFiles}
To allow extensions of systems, apps and components Def Files are now allowed to be \hyperlink{defFilesFormat_defFileFormatIncludeDirectives}{included into other Def Files}. To reuse common parts of the definition file, these parts can be separated into a common file, which is then included in each definition file where it is needed. This new feature is done by using \hyperlink{defFilesFormat_defFileFormatIncludeDirectives}{include directives}.\hypertarget{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesTdefSinc}{}\paragraph{Target Definition Files replaced with Sdef includes}\label{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesTdefSinc}
With the improvement of including Def Files into other Def Files, we have also been able to replace our Target Definition files with Sdef Include files. All build variables are now defined by {\ttfamily target/$\ast$}.sinc and are included in the target sdef\textquotesingle{}s. This allows a target to be built by running {\ttfamily  mksys -\/t $<$target$>$ } with only toolchain settings from the environment.\hypertarget{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesRemoteSIM}{}\paragraph{Remote S\+I\+M Service added}\label{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesRemoteSIM}

\item Transfer A\+TR
\item Power S\+IM off
\item Power S\+IM on
\item Reset S\+IM
\item Report Status
\item Error handling
\end{DoxyItemize}

The following optional features are not supported\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Transfer Card Reader Status
\item Set Transport Protocol
\end{DoxyItemize}

The {\ttfamily }.mdef files now support 2 methods of building drivers within the Legato AF. A new method has been added to build drivers straight from the source code instead of needed a pre-\/compiled {\ttfamily }.ko file.

See \hyperlink{defFilesMdef}{Kernel Module Definition .mdef} for details on how to bundle {\ttfamily }.c files into a kernel object.\hypertarget{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesDualSS}{}\paragraph{Dual System Support}\label{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesDualSS}
Dual System consists of managing 2 copies of most code areas, the A\+C\+T\+I\+VE system (currently used, Read-\/\+Only) and U\+P\+D\+A\+TE system (backup, Read-\/\+Write). \hyperlink{c_fwupdate}{Firmware Update A\+PI} now supports updating both the A\+C\+T\+I\+VE and U\+P\+D\+A\+TE systems.

For more information please see \hyperlink{platformConstraintsDualSys}{Dual System mechanism}.\hypertarget{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesMinimumArray}{}\paragraph{Minimum array and string sizes deprecated}\label{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesMinimumArray}
In A\+PI files the Minimum array and string sizes have been deprecated, due to minimum sizes not being properly enforced.

The following function will now return the error\+: {\ttfamily  reusable/\+I\+N\+F\+R\+A\+\_\+\+Cmd\+Mng/\+Cmd\+Server/api/\+Cmd\+Mng\+Ipc.\+api\+:8\+:16\+: error\+: Unexpected character u\textquotesingle{}.\textquotesingle{} }

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesTools}{}\paragraph{Tooling Changes}\label{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesTools}
The following changes have been made to the Legato AF Tools\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Auto-\/\+Complete is now added for both zsh and bash commands
\item \hyperlink{buildToolsmkexe}{mkexe} is now able to package and build drivers from kernel objects or {\ttfamily }.c sources.
\item \hyperlink{buildToolsifgen}{ifgen} -\/ \hyperlink{apiFilesSyntax_apiFilesSyntax_types}{data type handler} has been deprecated; User-\/defined type {\ttfamily H\+A\+N\+D\+L\+ER} is to be used instead
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesExperimental}{}\subsubsection{Experimental Features}\label{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesExperimental}
\hypertarget{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesExperimentalAirVantage}{}\paragraph{Air\+Vantage Connector Version 2}\label{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesExperimentalAirVantage}
Air\+Vantage Connect version 2 has been launched as an {\bfseries experimental} {\bfseries version}. Version 2 upgrades the Air\+Vantage Connector to improve support for Asset Data and Time\+Series management.

Air\+Vantage 1.\+0 is no longer enabled in 17.\+05.\+0 and above.

A\+VC 2.\+0 New Features\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Asset data can be dynamically created within the application and there is no need to define the data model in the {\ttfamily }.cdef
\item Asset data settings now support read/write from the Air Vantage Server
\item Asset data definitions have changed to resources (paths)
\item Time\+Series is no longer coupled with asset data
\item Time\+Series enables users to aggregate multiple data points into a single push
\item Time\+Series Observe function has been replaced with a push function.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The \hyperlink{avMigration}{Air\+Vantage 1.\+0 to 2.\+0 Migration} contains details on the changes between Air\+Vantage V1 and Air\+Vantage V2 and how to migrate your configuration.

\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
To sync Air\+Vantage with a 17.\+05 Legato System Build, an extra step must be done to update the version number before you upload the \hyperlink{avInstallUpload_avInstallUpload_CustomSystem}{System Bundle to sync with Air\+Vantage.}
\end{DoxyWarning}
The Air\+Vantage documentation has been reorganized and is now located within the \hyperlink{legatoServicesAirVantage}{Air\+Vantage Connector Documentation}\hypertarget{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesExperimentalReadOnly}{}\paragraph{Read Only Mode}\label{releaseNotes17050_rn17_05_FeaturesExperimentalReadOnly}
In Legato AF Read-\/\+Only mode the system tree is built and deployed into a squashfs or ubifs image making the system read-\/only. Any system configuration must be done before the system is built an installed on to the Target Device.

While Legato is built as Read-\/\+Only the following actions are restricted\+: -\/\+Running Apps within Sandboxes -\/\+Installation or removal of Legato Apps and/or Services -\/\+Software over-\/the-\/air updates through Air\+Vantage -\/\+Additions of new nodes to the Config Tree (values can still be changed) -\/\+Modifications to the root file-\/system (e.\+g., changing passwords)

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
 Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
 the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
 Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
 than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
 License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
 license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
 the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

\begin{DoxyVerb}GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By
contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software
Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for
your libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses
are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or
to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you
if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get
the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to
the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you
this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that
there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed
on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any
problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger
that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License,
which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be
sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.

The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we
usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a
library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous
to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the
linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General
Public License treats it as such.

Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not
effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all
benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is
intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your
freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We
have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as
regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster
development of free libraries.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close
attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the
library". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together
with the library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather
than by this special one.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
Library General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently
linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under
these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or
with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a
library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they
are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output
from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library
(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on
what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive
it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with
the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer
warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based
on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files
and the date of any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the
terms of this License.
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by
an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is
invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does
not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
purpose remains meaningful.
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application
does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are
not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute
them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work
based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
derivative or collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a
work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
work under the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License
to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this
License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to
this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU
General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is
not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in
object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then
offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along
with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with
the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope
of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a
derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that
uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for
distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library,
the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is
not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library,
or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by
law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and
small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing
this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the
work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work that uses the
Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that
work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the
customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that
the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the
work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the
Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you
must do one of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library
including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2
above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user
can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified
Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user
the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing
this distribution.
c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer
equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent
this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and
utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the
source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary
libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single
library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a
combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of
the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with
any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on
the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else
grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based
on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify
the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on
the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties to this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other
reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,
the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in
other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right
claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the
author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest
of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by
patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General
Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of
this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms
and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution
conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software
which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the
free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,
OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO
YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
 publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
 Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
 where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
 by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

 Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 as of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 meet the following conditions:

 (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 stating that You changed the files; and
 (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 the Derivative Works; and
 (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 as modifying the License.

 You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 of titON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\end{DoxyVerb}

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Legato Project!

Like other open source projects we require a signed contribution agreement on file in order to be able to accept contributions.\hypertarget{aboutLegatoContributing_aboutLegatoContributing_agreement}{}\subsection{Contribution Agreement}\label{aboutLegatoContributing_aboutLegatoContributing_agreement}
If you are contributing as an {\bfseries Individual\+:} 


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Print the \href{https://github.com/legatoproject/legato-af/blob/master/CONTRIB_INDIVIDUAL.md}{\tt Individual Contribution Doc} from the Legato-\/af repo on Git\+Hub.
\item Complete and sign the bottom of the agreement.
\item Scan and send a P\+DF copy to \href{mailto:legal@legato.io}{\tt legal@legato.\+io}.
\item Once the agreement has been reviewed and approved you will receive an acceptance email and your Git\+Hub ID will be added to the project.
\item Contribute to the \href{https://github.com/legatoproject/}{\tt Legato Project on Git\+Hub}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The Legato AF is distributed as multiple repositories. To download all the repositories as one project we recommend using Google\textquotesingle{}s \href{https://code.google.com/p/git-repo/}{\tt Repo tool}.\hypertarget{aboutLegatoContributing_aboutLegatoContributing_commitMsg}{}\subsection{Commit Message Format}\label{aboutLegatoContributing_aboutLegatoContributing_commitMsg}
For code to be accepted, commit messages must use the following format\+:

{\bfseries Summary statement} Capitalized, 50 characters or less. Explain the problem this commit is solving.

{\bfseries Body} Following the summary statement (and blank line), a paragraph can include more detailed explanations. Provide a general description of how the problem is solved including any important assumptions or consequences. The blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body entirely) as tools like {\ttfamily log}, {\ttfamily shortlog} and {\ttfamily rebase} can get confused if you run the two together. Lines exceeding 72 characters in width (including whitespace) should be split into multiple lines. Additional paragraphs should be split by blank lines.

Write your commit message in the imperative\+: \char`\"{}\+Fix bug\char`\"{} and not \char`\"{}\+Fixed bug\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}\+Fixes bug\char`\"{}. This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Bullet points} are also permitted. Use a hanging indent.
\item Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a single space, with blank lines in between.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries Resolves\+: \#xxx} Include the Git\+Hub issue number in this format.

\begin{DoxyVerb}Fix bug

Resolved an issue where a loop never completes as it always escapes with "system error"

Consolidate the following functions:
- redfish()
- bluefish()

Resolves: #101
\end{DoxyVerb}
\hypertarget{aboutLegatoContributing_aboutLegatoContributing_bugs}{}\subsection{Report Bugs}\label{aboutLegatoContributing_aboutLegatoContributing_bugs}
The easiest way to contribute to Legato is by reporting bugs. We use Git\+Hub\textquotesingle{}s issue tracking for our bug reporting. Go to \href{https://github.com/legatoproject/legato-af/issues}{\tt Legato Issues} to report a new bug.
